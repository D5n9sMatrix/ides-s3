to refer to the set of all n Ã— m matrices with real elements.
We use the notation (A)ij to refer to the element in the ith row and the
j column of the matrix A; that is, in equation (1.4), (A)ij = aij .
Two matrices are equal if and only if they are of the same shape and each
element of one matrix is equal to the corresponding element of the other.
Although vectors are column vectors and the notation in equations (1.1)
and (1.2) represents the same entity, that would not be the same for matrices.
If x1 , . . . , xn are scalars
